# Array Binary Search

Binary search in a sorted 1D array

## Challenge

Write a function that takes in 2 parameters (sorted array, search key), return the index of the array's element that is equal to the search key or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency

First, we talked about what binary search is, then defined the range of the search, what kind of loop we need, and how to change the search range.
